Use Sample_ID_Lookup_table.xlsx to find raw fastq, bams and count matrix data on HTAN DCC, GDC and CDS

Cell type annotation for tumor GBM and ccRCC samples is available on GEO: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE240822 (please see supplementary files)

We are working to make cell type annotation avaiable via HTAN DCC for all other cancer types. Stay tuned!
