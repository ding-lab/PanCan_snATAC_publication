f, Regulon activities of PITX3 in GBM and KLF6 in PDAC are shown across normal (green), primary (blue), and metastasis (red) cells. The x-axis represents the regulon activity, while the y-axis indicates the density of cells.
g, The Kaplan-Meier survival curves display the validated survival significance of regulons identified in this study across TCGA cohorts for PITX3 in TCGA-GBM and KLF6 in TCGA-PDAC. The curves represent the probability of survival over time for patients with high and low expression of the corresponding regulons.
h, Regulon activity of KLF4 in HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC, both in this study (upper panel) and in TCGA dataset (lower panel).
