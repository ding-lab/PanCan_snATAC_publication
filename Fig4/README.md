# Fig.4: Pan-Cancer and cancer-specific regulons.

---

**Directory structure**

* `Run_SCENIC` -- infer regulons using SCENIC


* `Post_SCENIC` -- scripts for updating regulons based on frequency across iterations; and for identifying differential regulons: each cancer vs others (tumor cells only), and tumor cells vs CNC.


* `ENCODE_4f-g` -- validation of regulons' targets using ChIP-seq data (ENCODE).
